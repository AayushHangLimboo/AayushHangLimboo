Hey, I'm Aayush Hang Limboo 👋

I'm a beginner exploring web development and game design through small, self-taught projects. Most of what you'll find here is a work-in-progress, learning by doing is how I roll.

🧠 What I'm Interested In:
- Frontend development (HTML, CSS, JS)
- Unity game development (C#)
- Building things that feels rewarding to finish

🔨 What I'm Working On:
- Learning how to structure real-world projects
- Writing better, cleaner code
- Finishing and polishing my mini-projects

📂 Projects (WIP ⚒️):
- WeatherApp – basic weather UI with HTML/JS  
- MovieSiteWebApp – exploring layout and interactivity  
- CodePrep_FAQ_Page – simple FAQ page UI  
- UnityProjectsTest – small experiments with C# in Unity  
- portfolio – my personal site (still rough)

📂 Projects ( Finished 👌 ):
-  Rock Paper Scissor Game(Basic HTML CSS & JS)-(Deployment Link: https://rock-paper-scissor-game-cyjl.vercel.app/ ).
  
> Most of these are ongoing as I build skills and confidence. I update them whenever I improve or learn something new.

🌱 Current goal:
- Finishing what I started
